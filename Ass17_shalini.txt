1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are different
   from one another,and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.   
Ans-

	create table orders

	(
		onum char(4) primary key,
		cnum char(4),

		snum char(4),
		
odate date not null,

		unique (cnum,snum)

	);

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted,
   snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M,
   inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).   
Ans-
	create table salespeople
	(
		snum char(4) primary key,
		sname varchar(20) check( upper(sname)),
		comm float(4,2) not null default 0.10,
		check(sname between 'A' and 'M')	
	);

3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum,
   and the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields. 
Ans-

	create table orders12
	(
		onum char(4) primary key,
		cnum char(4) not null,
		snum char(4) not null,
		odate date not null,
		check(onum>cnum and cnum>snum)
	);
