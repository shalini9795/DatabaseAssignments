   the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

	(SELECT (select CASE WHEN customers.Rating >=200 THEN 'High rating' else 'Low rating' END),city,cname,rating from customers)

	union

	(SELECT (select CASE WHEN customers.Rating <200 THEN 'Low rating' else 'High Rating' END),city,cname,rating from customers)

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose;
   the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3.
   Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.    
   (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.).
